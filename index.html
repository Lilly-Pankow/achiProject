	Here are the steps of this project. <br>
	I totally forgot about having to use JQuery, making almost everything from scratch. <br>
	If anything, I borrowed from people who solved problems similar to mine on StackOverflow <br>
	and similar sites.  Mainly the code that figures out which element was clicked.<br>
	&nbsp It took me about three days to make everything, but not putting in long hours each day. <br>
	&nbsp Also made the images myself. Took at most 30 minutes, mostly to get the colors nice. <br>
	&nbsp Credit to my younger brother for play testing the final game and finding a bug.

    <li><a href="html/ticTacToe.html">Basic Tic-Tac-Toe</a> <br>
		Uses a table and innerHTML to set the cell to either X or O when clicked on.<br>
		Does not allow for user to overwrite a taken space.
	</li>
	<li><a href="html/tTTConCheck.html">Narrated Tic-Tac-Toe</a></li>
		Same as previous, but has an additional section where winner is announced. <br>
		It also informs users of invalid moves, or if it ends in a stalemate.
	<li><a href="html/tTTPicture.html">Image Tic-Tac-Toe</a><br>
		Similar to the previous two, but uses an image in place of text. <br>
		It has the appearance of an Achi board but plays as Tic-Tac-Toe.
	</li>
	<li><a href = "html/achiGame.html">Achi</a><br>
		The game that is required.
